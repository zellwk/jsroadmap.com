        ## About the teacher

        Hey, I'm Zell. I've helped over 30,000 developers like yourself learn about frontend development every month.

        Like you, I was deathly afraid of JavaScript when I first started. I couldn't understand it. Nothing I read would register in my head. I used to think that's because I don't have a programming background.

        But that's not true. After becoming fluent with JavaScript, I realized that anyone can become good at it, and I want to help you get to where I am.

      <div class="c-testimonial">
        <blockquote>
          {% markdown %}
          When I stumbled on Zell's articles, I was looking for in-depth tutorials. His articles helped me solve critical problems I had while completing an assignment for a job application. As a result, I got a front end web dev job abroad, in the wonderful city of Lausanne in Switzerland!

          What I loved about his work is that they're really *detailed but not overwhelming*. He guides the reader slowly from basics to more advanced concepts, *step by step*, taking time to *make sure everything gets well understood before going deeper*. He understands my needs, offers solutions, but doesn't force me into a one.

        <blockquote>
          {% markdown %}
          I've been writing software for 20 years, long enough to know that getting expert, *thorough and well written* help on new topics was hopeless. People like Zell, who go out and become experts, then work hard to teach others like me are the reason software is easier fun to write these days. I'd *gladly pay for the excellent content that Zell produces* â€“ it's so much more efficient to learn from experts like him.

        <blockquote>
          {% markdown %}
          I like Zell's explanation style and *ability to split complicated stuff into chewable fragments*. The explanation itself *does not make me feel a bit stupid*. On the contrary, I got it, so I'm able to move forward.
